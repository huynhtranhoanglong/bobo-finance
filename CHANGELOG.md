## [1.0.14] - 2026-01-11

### Security Fixes
- **Data Isolation & RLS Enforcement**:
  - **Critical Fix**: Patched `get_financial_metrics` RPC function which was previously exposing financial metrics (Net Worth, Safety Targets) across different user accounts due to missing parameters.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-01-11

### Bug Fixes

## [1.8.3] - 2026-01-23

### Bug Fix: Debt Dropdown in Repayment Mode
> **Purpose**: Fix issue where debt dropdown was empty in "Trả nợ" (Debt Repayment) mode.

- **Root Cause**:
  - Data from `bottom-nav.tsx` already filtered debts with `.eq('type', 'payable')`.
  - But `add-transaction-drawer.tsx` tried to filter again with `.filter(d => d.type === 'payable')`.
  - Since `type` field was not included in the select query, all items were filtered out.

- **Fix**:
  - Removed redundant client-side filter in drawer component.
  - Debts are now properly displayed in dropdown.

### Technical Details
- **Modified File**: `components/add-transaction-drawer.tsx`
  - Line 363: Removed `.filter(d => d.type === 'payable')`

### Code Quality - Centralized UI Labels (i18n Preparation)
> **Purpose**: Created a centralized labels file to prepare for internationalization (i18n) support and ensure consistency in UI text across the application.

- **New File**: `utils/labels.ts`
  - Contains ~200 label constants organized by functional groups
  - Groups: Common, Transactions, Wallets, Debts, Dashboard, Filters, Login, Notifications, Feedback
  - Follows naming convention: `LABEL_[CONTEXT]_[DESCRIPTION]`

- **Refactored Components** (17 files):
  - **Dialogs**: `add-transaction-dialog.tsx`, `edit-transaction-dialog.tsx`, `create-wallet-dialog.tsx`, `edit-wallet-dialog.tsx`, `create-debt-dialog.tsx`, `edit-debt-dialog.tsx`, `feedback-dialog.tsx`

> **Note**: This completes the i18n preparation phase. Future work can add multi-language support by replacing `utils/labels.ts` with a proper i18n library.

## [1.3.18] - 2026-01-17

### Bug Fix - Duplicate Funds in Create Wallet Dialog
> **Issue**: When a family owner opens the "Create Wallet" dialog, the "Fund" dropdown shows duplicate entries (e.g., 12 items instead of 4) because each family member has their own set of default funds.
> **Fix**: Updated `get_dashboard_data` RPC to use `DISTINCT ON (name)` to return only unique fund names.

- **Database**:
  - Updated `get_dashboard_data` RPC function.
  - Query now returns deduplicated funds list based on fund name.
  - **SQL Script**: `sql_backup/202601170830_fix_duplicate_funds.sql`.

> **Note**: This fix maintains the existing database structure for future flexibility (allowing users to customize funds if needed).

## [1.3.17] - 2026-01-17

### UX Improvement - Greeting Logic & Refactoring
> **Purpose**: Improved the greeting display logic to avoid showing email as a fallback name, and eliminated hardcoded strings in the greeting component.

- **Frontend Updates**:
  - `components/greeting-header.tsx`: Refactored to use centralized logic from `utils/timezone.ts`. The greeting now **only** shows the name if explicitly set by the user. If no name is set, it displays a simple greeting (e.g., "☀️ Chào buổi sáng!") without the email.
  - `app/account/page.tsx`: Updated to fallback to email for the heading (`H2`) if the display name is empty, ensuring the user still knows which account they are viewing.

- **Code Quality - Constants**:
  - `utils/constants.ts`: Added constants for all greeting texts and icons (`GREETING_TEXT_*`, `GREETING_ICON_*`).
  - `utils/timezone.ts`: Updated to use constants instead of hardcoded strings.

- **Database**:
  - Updated `get_my_profile` RPC logic to **STOP defaulting display_name to email**. It now returns `null` if no name is set.
  - **SQL Script**: `sql_backup/202601170900_update_get_my_profile_v2.sql`.

## [1.3.16] - 2026-01-17

  - `withOpacity()` helper function to create rgba colors with opacity
  - Export aliases: `COLOR_POSITIVE`, `COLOR_NEGATIVE`, `COLOR_NEUTRAL`, `COLOR_BRAND`, `COLOR_BRAND_HOVER`
  - Type annotation `: string` to prevent TypeScript literal type conflicts

- **Refactored Components** (15 files):
  - `components/monthly-stats.tsx` - Removed local COLOR_* declarations

  - `components/financial-progress.tsx` - Replaced inline hex colors
  - `components/transaction-filters.tsx` - Replaced inline hex colors
  - `components/ui/pull-to-refresh.tsx` - Replaced inline hex colors

  - `app/family/page.tsx` - Replaced inline hex colors
  - `app/invite/[token]/page.tsx` - Replaced inline hex colors
  - `app/transactions/page.tsx` - Replaced inline hex colors

> **Benefit**: To change the brand color, now only need to edit ONE file (`utils/colors.ts`). All components will automatically update.
> **Note**: This is a pure refactoring change. No UI or logic changes.

## [1.3.15] - 2026-01-17

### Code Quality - Centralized Constants
> **Purpose**: Eliminated "magic numbers" by creating a centralized constants file for better maintainability and code clarity.

- **New File**: `utils/constants.ts`
  - Contains all configurable constants with descriptive names and JSDoc comments

  - `components/fund-group.tsx` - Uses `EMERGENCY_FUND_*_MONTHS` instead of hardcoded `3`, `6`
  - `utils/timezone.ts` - Uses `GREETING_*_START` instead of hardcoded `5`, `12`, `18`, `22`

- **Documentation**:
  - Added section "9.6. Hằng Số Cấu Hình (Constants)" to `LOGIC_CALCULATIONS.md`
  - Full mapping table of all constants with values, meanings, and usage locations

> **Note**: This is a pure refactoring change. No logic or behavior changes. SQL constants remain unchanged as PostgreSQL does not support global constants.

## [1.3.14] - 2026-01-16

### Bug Fix - Create Wallet/Debt Missing Family ID
> **Issue**: When a family member creates a new wallet or debt, the `family_id` was not being set, causing items to not appear on the family dashboard.

- **Database**:
  - Fixed `create_wallet_with_initial_balance` function to include `family_id` and `visibility`.
  - Fixed `create_new_debt_v2` function to include `family_id` for both debt record and transaction.
  - **SQL Scripts**: 
    - `sql_backup/202601162220_fix_create_wallet_family_id.sql`
    - `sql_backup/202601162230_hotfix_create_debt_family_id.sql`

## [1.3.13] - 2026-01-16

### Feature - Device Timezone Localization
> **Change**: All timezone-dependent calculations now use the user's device timezone instead of hardcoded Vietnam timezone.
> Technical solution: Cookie-based approach for Server Component compatibility.

- **New Files**:
  - `utils/timezone.ts` - Centralized timezone utility with functions:
    - `getUserTimezone()` - Returns device timezone

## [1.3.12] - 2026-01-16

### Improvement - Net Worth Calculation
> **Change**: Updated the Net Worth formula to include receivable debts (money others owe you).
> **Old Formula**: Total Assets - Payable Debts
> **New Formula**: Total Assets - Payable Debts + Receivable Debts

- **Database**:
  - Updated `get_dashboard_data` RPC function to calculate and include `total_receivable` in the response.
  - Added a new variable to query the sum of all receivable debts with remaining balance > 0.

## [1.3.11] - 2026-01-16

### Bug Fix - Transaction Logic (Family Mode)
> **Issue**: Deleting or updating transactions in family mode (shared wallets) did not correctly update the wallet balance or debt status.
> **Fix**: Implemented new RPC functions `delete_transaction_v3` and `update_transaction_v3` with `SECURITY DEFINER` to ensuring proper permission handling for balance recalculations across family members.

- **Backend**:
  - Added `sql_backup/202601161815_fix_delete_transaction_v3.sql`.
  - Updated `app/actions.ts` to call v3 RPC functions.

## [1.3.10] - 2026-01-16

### Bug Fix - FAB Positioning
> **Issue**: The Floating Action Button (FAB) was not sticky and scrolled with the page content.
> **Cause**: The "Pull to Refresh" feature introduced a CSS transform that broke the `fixed` positioning context of child elements.

### Bug Fixes - Family Feature

> **Critical Fix:** This release fixes bugs that prevented the Family feature from working after creation.

- **Fixed: RLS Circular Dependency**:
  - Root cause: `families` policy checked `family_members`, and `family_members` policy checked `families` → deadlock.
  - Fix: Added direct owner/user checks to break the circular dependency.
  - `families` policy: `owner_id = auth.uid() OR ...`
  - `family_members` policy: `user_id = auth.uid() OR ...`

- **Fixed: Column `profiles.email` does not exist**:

  - Family debts/transactions: All records with matching `family_id`.
  - Prepared for future private wallet feature.

- Updated version indicator to `v1.3.1`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-16

### Major Feature - Family (Phase 1: Database Foundation)

> **Note:** This release adds the database foundation for the Family feature. UI will be added in future phases.

- **New Database Tables**:

  - Dropdown menus for wallet selection now render correctly without HTML structure warnings.

### Code Cleanup

- Removed unused `formatMoney` function from `financial-overview.tsx` and `financial-progress.tsx`.

  - Updated `app/transactions/page.tsx` to properly retrieve wallet balances from the database.

### UX Improvements - Filters & Refactor
- **Reset Filter Button**:

## [1.2.6] - 2026-01-16

### Bug Fixes - Timezone Logic
- **Fixed Transaction Filtering Issue**:
  - Previously, filtering by "Today" or "Yesterday" used UTC time, causing discrepancies for users in different timezones (e.g., Vietnam UTC+7).
  - **New Logic**: 
    - Frontend now generates date strings based on **Local Device Time**.
    - Backend query applies the local date range [00:00:00 - 23:59:59] converted correctly to UTC.
  - Users will now see accurate results matching their local day when using filters.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-01-16

### Features - Enhanced Debt Management (Historical Debts)
- **Historical Debt Entry**:
  - Added support for entering existing debts that have been partially paid before using the app.
  - **New Fields**: 
    - `Paid Amount`: Users can input the amount already paid.
    - `Just Record`: Option to only record the debt ledger without creating a transaction or affecting wallet balances.
  - **Logic**:
    - If "Just Record" is checked: Records debt with `Remaining = Total - Paid` and progress calculated. No wallet changes.
    - If "Just Record" is unchecked: Creates an incoming/outgoing transaction only for the *remaining* amount (actual cash flow).
  - **Solves the use case where users want to track long-term debts without disrupting their current wallet balances.
- **Enhanced Debt Editing**:
  - Updated **Edit Debt Dialog** to support modifying "Paid Amount".
  - **Just Record Mode**: Consistent with creation, users can choose to update the debt ledger only.
  - **Smart Wallet Sync**: If "Just Record" is disabled, the system automatically calculates the difference (new remaining vs old remaining) and creates an adjustment transaction (Income/Expense) to keep the wallet balance accurate.

### Technical Details
- Added `sql_backup/202601160600_create_new_debt_v2.sql` - New RPC `create_new_debt_v2`.
- Added `sql_backup/202601160800_update_debt_v2.sql` - New RPC `update_debt_v2`.
- Updated `components/create-debt-dialog.tsx` - Added UI for Paid Amount and Just Record mode.
- Updated `components/edit-debt-dialog.tsx` - Added UI for Paid Amount and Just Record mode with difference calculation logic.
- Updated `app/actions.ts` - Integrated new RPC logic for both create and update.
- **Data Query Fix**: Updated `get_dashboard_data` RPC to include 'receivable' (loans I gave) in the Debts list, previously hidden by a filter.
- **UI Refinement**: 
  - `DebtCard`: Aligned colors with brand palette (Green for Receivable, Red for Payable). Updated text to "% đã được trả" for loans given.
  - `Create/Edit Debt`: Context-aware labels ("Số tiền đã được trả") for receivable debts.
  - `AddTransaction`: Excluded "Receivable" debts from the "Debt Repayment" list to prevent logic errors.
- **Smart Sorting**: Updated Dashboard Debt list sorting logic:
  1. **Priority 1**: Payable debts (top) -> Receivable loans (bottom).
  2. **Payable Priority**: High Interest -> Low Interest, then Smallest Amount -> Largest Amount (Snowball method).
  3. **Receivable Priority**: Largest Amount -> Smallest Amount.
- **UX Fix**: Removed server-side `revalidatePath("/")` from `updateDebtAction` to prevent page scroll reset on update. Relies on client-side `router.refresh()` for smoother experience.



### Performance Optimizations

- **Unified Dashboard API (Single RPC)**:
  - Consolidated 5 separate API calls (wallets, debts, funds, metrics, monthly_stats) into a single `get_dashboard_data` RPC function.
  - Reduces network overhead and improves Dashboard load time significantly.
  - **Database Script**: `sql_backup/202601152000_get_dashboard_data.sql`

- **Singleton Supabase Client**:
  - Implemented singleton pattern for browser Supabase client to reuse connection instead of creating new instances on every call.
  - Modified `utils/supabase/client.ts`.

  - Static data (wallets, debts, funds, user) no longer reloads when adding/editing/deleting transactions.
  - Faster perceived performance after transaction operations.

### UX Improvements

- **Skeleton Loading**:
  - Replaced plain "Đang tải..." text with animated skeleton placeholders.
  - Added `components/ui/skeleton.tsx` with variants: `Skeleton`, `DashboardSkeleton`, `TransactionListSkeleton`.
  - Applied to Transaction History page for smooth loading experience.

### Technical Details
- Modified `app/page.tsx` - Refactored to use single RPC call.
- Modified `app/transactions/page.tsx` - Separated static data fetch from transactions fetch.

- Added `components/ui/skeleton.tsx` - New skeleton loading components.
- Added `sql_backup/202601152000_get_dashboard_data.sql` - New unified RPC function.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Wallet Balance NaN Display**:
  - PostgreSQL `decimal` type returns as string in JSON response from RPC, causing `Intl.NumberFormat` to display "NaN".
  - Added `Number()` wrapper to all wallet balance references to ensure proper type conversion.
  - **Affected Files**: `add-transaction-dialog.tsx`, `create-debt-dialog.tsx`, `wallet-card.tsx`, `edit-wallet-dialog.tsx`.

- **Transfer Dialog Enhancement**:
  - Added wallet balance preview to "From Wallet" and "To Wallet" dropdowns in Transfer dialog.

### UX Improvements - Visual Feedback
- **Global Loading Screen**: 
  - Implemented a branded loading screen featuring the Bobo Logo with a gentle **pulse animation**.
  - Provides immediate visual feedback during initial app load and page transitions.
- **Interactive Button Loading**: 
  - All action buttons (Create, Save, Delete, Send) now display a **spinning loader icon** during processing.
  - Replaces static "Loading..." text with dynamic visual indicators, reducing perceived wait time.
  - Applied to all dialogs: Transaction, Wallet, Debt, and Feedback.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-15

### UX Improvements - Mobile Optimization
- **Disable Dialog Autofocus**: 
  - Disabled automatic focus functionality on all input dialogs to prevent the mobile keyboard from popping up unexpectedly and covering the screen content.
  - Affected components: `CreateDebtDialog`, `CreateWalletDialog`, `EditDebtDialog`, `EditWalletDialog`, `EditTransactionDialog`.
  - Improves visual clarity and control for users on small screens (390x844).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-15
